### Hi, I'm Moshe! 👋

I love coffee ☕, Linux 🐧, psychological thrillers 😲, and working on whatever projects I feel like 💻.

A few things I'm working on at the moment:

- [Morfix Lite](https://github.com/outofink/morfix-lite) - An extremely lightweight front-end alternative for Morfix.
- [Notes](https://github.com/outofink/notes) - My notes for university, LaTeX.
- [Shades](https://github.com/outofink/shades) - A simple yet addicting color guessing game.
